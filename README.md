![](https://img.devrant.io/devrant/rant/r_90236_82j59.gif)

For this exercise, you will be debugging a VERY buggy Rails app. We will take a look at how the app should function before you get started. 

Work in pairs and try to get as far as you can. THERE ARE LIKE 23 BUGS I THINK. HARD TO SAY. You will have an hour to complete this exercise.

### Setup
* Clone from the class Repo
* Run bundle intall
* Run rails db:migrate
* Run Rails s

### How to do this
* 1. Read the Error
* 2. Think about the error
* 3. Google the Error
* 4. Use debugging tools (puts, byebug)
* BONUS - Have fun
